The first pages of this site (Intro and Objects and Data) as well as the regressions page build upon [Econometrics with R](https://schliebs.github.io/Applied_Econometrics_with_R) - a tutorial for students at Zeppelin University. Credits go to [Marcel Schliebs](https://github.com/schliebs) with whom I designed and lead this class. 

"Objects and Data" examples and explanations are inspired by [Econometrics for R](http://www.urfie.net/).

The Data Viz Introduction is inspired by [The R Bootcamp](https://therbootcamp.github.io/) who employ the widely used mpg dataset and the accompanying coding instructions (see for example [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)) for their data visualization tutorial. 

Most of the other subpages and scripts are of my own making. This is especially true for all errors and bugs. If you find one, shoot me an email at benedikt (at) fritz.re
