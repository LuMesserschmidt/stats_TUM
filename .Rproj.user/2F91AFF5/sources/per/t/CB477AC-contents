# Intro

* R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. 
* An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code. In general, there are three parts (look at the cheat sheet below):
    + Header
    + Text
    + Codue chunks 
* The cool thing about RMarkdown is that it offers a plain and easy to understand way to link code and documentation.   
* Furthermore, it is also very straight forward to produce html, pdf or docx outputs from RMarkdow. For example, this website is mainly based on Markdown.

# Setup
The cheat sheet offers a pretty good introduction:

# RNotebook

Actually, I would highly recommend you to use instead of R Markdown the more convenient R Notebook. It has all the functionality of R Markdown plus

* code chunks can be rendered independently and step by step
* You do not `knit` but `preview` documents - this makes sharing work easier

Basically, it works in the exact same way as R Markdown (see example below).
